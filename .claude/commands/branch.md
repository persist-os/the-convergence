# Branch Command (Worktree-Based)

Create an isolated worktree before starting work. Never work directly on main.

## Steps

### 1. Check Current State

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git worktree list
```

### 2. If Uncommitted Changes Exist
- Ask: commit them first, stash them, or abort?

### 3. If Already in a Worktree (not main)
- Ask: continue here, or create new worktree?

### 4. If on Main, Get Branch Intention

Ask user for:
- **Type**: feat | fix | docs | refactor | test | chore
- **Description**: 2-4 words, kebab-case

### 5. Create Worktree and Open Terminal

```bash
PROJECT=$(basename $(pwd))
git worktree add -b <type>/<description> ../${PROJECT}-<type>-<description>
open -a Terminal ../${PROJECT}-<type>-<description>
```

### 6. Confirm

Report:
```
Worktree created and terminal opened!

Setup:
  Main directory: [current path] (stays on main)
  Worktree: ../${PROJECT}-<type>-<description> (on <type>/<description>)

You can now:
  1. Start Claude Code in the new terminal
  2. Work on your feature in isolation
  3. When done, use /ship to push and create PR

Cleanup (after merge):
  git worktree remove ../${PROJECT}-<type>-<description>
  git branch -d <type>/<description>
```
